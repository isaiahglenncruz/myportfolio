                <h2>Hello, I'm Isaiah.</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a member of the June 2022 graduating class at the 
                    University of California, Santa Cruz. Currently, I am eager 
                    to embark on my first journey in the tech industry; 
                    my communication and organization skills are 
                    heavily strengthened through my work as a Patient Care 
                    Coordinator at an optometric practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am interested in democratizing cloud computing, machine learning, 
                    and artificial intelligence technologies. By increasing the 
                    accessibility of these tools, I believe in the possibility 
                    of near-utopic quality of life by innovation that trends 
                    upward forever.
                </p>
