                <h1>Hello, I'm Isaiah.</h1>
                <p>
                    I am a member of the June 2022 graduating class at the University of 
                    California, Santa Cruz, where I received my Bachelor's of Science 
                    in Computer Science. I am eager to embark on my first  
                    journey in the tech industry, with a problem-solving mindset 
                    tailored through my work in customer service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Supporting the democratization of cloud computing, machine learning, 
                    and artificial intelligence solutions is of highest significance to my 
                    career goals. I believe in the mission of raising our global 
                    population's 
                    collective quality of life - I would like to contribute to  
                    it by driving innovation and supporting accessibility.
