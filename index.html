                <h1>Hello, I'm Isaiah.</h1>
                <p>
                    I am a member of the June 2022 graduating class at the University of 
                    California, Santa Cruz, where I received my Bachelor's of Science 
                    in Computer Science. I am eager to  embark on my first  
                    journey in the tech industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Supporting the democratization of cloud computing, machine learning, 
                    and artificial intelligence solutions is of highest significance to my 
                    career goals. I believe in the mission of raising our global 
                    population's 
                    collective quality of life - I would like to contribute to  
                    it by driving innovation and supporting accessibility.

                <p>Web-based chatbot application using tools provided by 
                    Amazon Web Services (AWS). Developed a workflow using AWS 
                    microservices to fully understand Retrieval Automated 
                    Generation for Generative AI. Users are able to have 
                    context-filled conversations about the Pokemon franchise, 
                    but are also able to modify the chatbot to allow for conversations 
                    about other topics.

                <p>With a team of 2 other members at the University of California, 
                    Santa Cruz, tailored a unit of artifical intelligence to 
                    perform well in a variant game of PacMan. Teams of two PacMen 
                    battled to defend food pellets on their territory while consuming 
                    those of the enemy team. Understood the problem in terms of a 
                    Stochastic Search and optimized our PacMen's 
                    behaviors through calculated heuristics.

                <h2>QueueUp</h2>
                <p>Took on my first instance of Full Stack Development through 
                    a web-based application's front-end and back-end creation. 
                    As the coronavirus pandemic eased, built 
                    QueueUp with the intention of empowering gamers to become 
                    more social and find people online with those similar intentions. 
                    Users are able to create an account, choose from a number of 
                    available games, and view or join available lobbies. Understood 
                    the complex requirements of dynamic webpages and the 
                    usage of back-end tools.
